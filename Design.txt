The architecture of this crate is as explained : 



With the use of the ADL, the minimal architecture needed to use an STM32 is composed of the folders :

-- Middleware
-- ARM
-- Components
-- hal
-- [board folder] as an example, we will use the f446re
-- stm32_common



hal and the f446re folder don't need dependencies in order to build their library

middleware need two dependencies hal and f446re




Done : 

build ==> 
	adl_middleware_p
	nucleo_f446re (Had to remove folder stp to have one als_config.ads)
	hal
	components


Need:

build ==> 
	stm32_common <== ARM
	components
